For the very very few people who might be interested in the Urinal Selection Algorithm:

The fundamental principles appear to be:

Primary Rule: Choose an empty urinal with no occupied neighbors if possible

Secondary Rule: If all empty urinals have at least one neighbor, it's still acceptable to choose one

Tertiary Rule: Choose the position that creates the best future arrangement for subsequent people

Final Rule: Only wait if absolutely all urinals are occupied


Analysis of Test Cases (0-indexed, 1 for occupied, 0 for empty)
[1,0,1,0,1] ‚Üí 1, 3
No urinal exists without neighbors
Both empty positions (1, 3) have exactly one neighbor
Both are equally good choices

[1,0,1,1,0,0] ‚Üí 5
Position 5 has no occupied neighbors (follows primary rule)
Position 1 has an occupied neighbor
Position 4 has an occupied neighbor
Position 5 is the clear best choice

[0,0,0] ‚Üí 0, 2
Positions 0 and 2 have no neighbors (first-tier choices)
Position 1 would be inferior because:
If chosen, positions 0 and 2 would both have a neighbor
If 0 or 2 is chosen, the other end spot would still be perfect

[1,1,1,1] ‚Üí wait
No empty urinals exist, so waiting is the only option

[0,0,0,0] ‚Üí 0,1,2,3
All positions have no occupied neighbors (all first-tier)
With completely empty urinals, end positions (0,3) might be slightly preferred
But all positions are acceptable as they don't create immediate problems

[0,1,0,0,0,1] ‚Üí 3
Positions 0, 3, and 4 have no occupied neighbors (all first-tier)
Position 2 has a neighbor, making it second-tier
Of the first-tier options, position 3 creates the most balanced distribution
